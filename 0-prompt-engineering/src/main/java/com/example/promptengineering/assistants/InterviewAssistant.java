            You need generate it in such way `|Question number|Question|Difficulty|Evaluation|Comment|`, where
             `Question number` is just incremented ordered question number, `Question` is the question that will be
             asked, `Difficulty` is rate from 1 to 10, `Evaluation` and `Comment` have to be empty because these fields
             are served for interviewer fulfillment.

             after each question its difficulty.
